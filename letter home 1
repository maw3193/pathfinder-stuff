Val's letter home:
==================
Dear Mum,

I got to the professor's funeral OK, but they have asked me to stay a little
longer. The prof had something in his will where we have to stay in Ravengro for
a month to look after his daughter, Kendra. She is very nice, but has not taken
her father's death very well.

The will also asked us to deliver some books to the University of Lepidstadt, so
I will be coming home in a month, so you can meet my new friends Harley, Rupert,
Antonio and Florian. They are the people who were also mentioned in the
Professor's will, and they have been helping me look into all the ghost stories
in town.

Harley came to Ravengro from Lepidstadt as well, so we must have been very
unlucky to not have met on the way. She only turned up about half an hour after
I did. She is very nice and likes making friends.

Rupert is a druid, which is a bit like a druid but not as scary. I read
somewhere that druids have an animal with them, but he doesn't because he hates
animals. He has a sickle which is very sharp, I don't think he's ever used it.

Antonio is a soldier from somewhere called 'Varentay'. I don't know where that
is, but he's got a funny accent, and apparently they burn their dead instead of
burying them. I think this might be a good idea, because I have seen 8 dead
people get up and they wouldn't be able to do that if they were ashes. Don't
worry, I'm not afraid of dead things.

Florian is my best friend. He's a dhampir, just like me. Maybe he invited both
of us to his funeral so I'd meet him. I always wanted a big brother. He's pretty
cool, but he likes sneaking off all the time. I followed him once and he found a
haunted toilet. That was pretty cool, but it nearly killed Antonio.

I hope Zordlon, Tessara, Valdon, Merisiel and all the gang are well. I can't
wait to be home.

See you soon,

Val
