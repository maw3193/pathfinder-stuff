* We are attacked by a spell-casting spiketopus who is angry about something.
* Octopert + Spiketopus 5eva

* Down at the bottom we find a big dome, and a passage back into the cliffside.
** OH MY GOD LOOK AT THE CRAFTSMANSHIP ON THAT DOME!
** AND HOW IS IT SO WELL-LIT?!
* We approach the cliffside and are attacked by a squad of fishmen
* Octopert flails most of them to death.
* We keep one alive, but he doesn't communicate - maybe he's mind-controlled.
** The fishman is explicitly male. Don't ask.

* We spot some suspiciously-coloured rocks - ILLUSION!
* Rupert shoves Eldas through the rocks and bangs his face against a portal.
* It leads to an air-filled cave with a bunch of cloudy side-doors and other stuff.
** Side-doors lead to fights with insect-looking plant-creatures with fingers as sharp as knives who try to dissect you. They buzz maddeningly (AKA will save damage).

** We send Eldas off to Lepidstadt to shop for diamond dust. Val briefly sees his mother but doesn't have much time to talk.
** Eldas shops for:
*** 1000gp diamond dust
*** 1000gp reincarnate oils
*** 500gp prayer beads
*** Scroll of fireball (450gp)
*** Scroll of Identify (50gp)
*** Scroll of teleport (1250gp) (to return)
*** Estimated total: 4250gp
** He has the skum squad's loot(~3600gp), the communal cash (~4000gp) and all the previous loot.

** We investigate a big pile of corpses. Rupert bear-forms and smells something in the middle of the pile.
** Val creates a pit in the centre and we start fighting.
** It is a creature with a sideways mouth in its head, four arms and is made almost entirely out of muscle.
** The only bone-shaped stuff was its teeth, which are shattered. It never gets to gum anyone to death, anyway.
** It creates sharp spikes all over the ground.
** Mia gets so many crits against it.
** Rupert bites its head off.

* We encounter a brain-shaped fungus with limbs and features that appear and disappear.
** It telepathically asks nonsense space questions, then attacks.
** It casts spells to summon various tentacley things.
** It rips into Val's mind for secrets. MY MEMORIES!
** Elowyn kills it with rays of magical light.
** WE FOUGHT GOOGLE!

* We investigate another side-door and find more of the plant creatures.
** Val goes in to help and OH GOD THE BUZZING!
** Val mysteriously finds out that they are responsible for the OH MY GOD BOX!

* Val and Mia have a look through a passage that leads away from the dome, and bicker about which way to go.
** Elowyn receives a mysterious tip-off from her "friend" that all is lost if we don't go straight to the dome.
** OH MY GOD, WHAT "FRIEND"?

* We follow the passage towards the dome and find a small shrine with a mace on a pedestal an a statue with an eel/fish/octopus creature. Oh, and a priest with two lackeys.
** The lackeys have exposed brains. Eurgh.
** The leader summons a monstery water elemental, which Val fills with fear, making it useless.
** The leader called down a pillar of fire, dispelled a Spiritual Ally and channelled negative energy. He spent most of the fight backed into a corner while his minions failed to hit Rupert.

* The mace on the pedestal is an artifact of Pharasma, the Raven's Head. It was an important holy symbol of a bishop a long time ago, but was lost in a big battle. 
* It's a +3 undead bane heavy mace, a good upgrade for Elowyn's weapon.

* Rupert investigates the statue - it has 7 indentations. He goes into a trance and finds out the relationship between Dagon and whatever this god is. He refuses to tell explain further than "heresies within heresies" for the sake of our sanity.
** VERY suspicious.

* We continue deeper and find a couple more plant creatures, one of them has a magical rod thing.
** He shoots a cloud of mist out of it at us, giving us all concealment. Mia dodges it completely.
** They don't fight very well - one of them falls over and is sneak-attacked to death. The other one is crunched by druids and oracles.

* We partially identify the staff - caster level 10 cone of cold (DC17 reflex save) that leaves a fog cloud. Needs a DC30 Use Magic Device to activate and has 17 charges left.
* We have a look at a pile of corpses and a big machine - the corpses have had their brains removed. The box appears to be a magical shredder they were using to dispose of the bodies.
