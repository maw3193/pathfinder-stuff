- Flo steals Val's diary
- Flo scouts out the outbuilding next to the tower, sneaky sneaky. Lots of undead, one powerful one plus some minions (NB: look into getting minions)
- Clara goes rune bashing and omg ghosts everywhar! On the plus side, the fog also disappears. Mysterious screams - hopefully Antonio, if he's even here, will be very sad if this is another Duristan lie </3
- Flo's awesome plan: turn invisible and thieve the urn from the outbuilding. Boss has life sense, fml. Combat begins, flo is slightly mauled and bravely runs away to be sneaky sneaky. Clara bashes undead and Eldas flails magic at them. 
- Post combat, Clara opens the urn. It doesn't smell good and has floating chunks of heart in it. Eldas does some magicy stuff, apparently it's Wollenstag (because Flo prefers the less popular german spelling) wolfie heart. Eldas also finds a small pot with some pretty colour changing paste in it. Flo wants to wear it as war stripes but Eldas says no, grumpy grumpy.
- Leave the outbuilding, ghosts still lurkin', omnomnom tasty adventurers. Summon wolfies, flee town. Not-Jesus, Val-dy and that weird stalker guy follow some horse tracks away from the tower. Eldas, Clara and Florian venture towards Carrion Hill. On the way, Eldas identifies the paste as 'Marvellous Pigment' - paint something and you can create it.
- Eldas uses 'Minor Creation' to make Flo a pet rock with wheels. Not as awesome as a pet Duristan.
- Days in town: Eldas heals Flo, Flo is forced to pay 100gp so makes sure to do it in copper pieces. Clara gets herself a smexy elf bard, who wishes to venture with us. She also gets a new tattoo. Flo looks into the price of a pet kitten after being told he can't have Duristan as his pet/tea-bitch. Clara buys Flo a pretty crown, she becomes his new best friend (sorry Val).
