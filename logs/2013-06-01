* The flying bird-like creature does not breathe and is not obeying our laws of gravity.
* The mansion door burst open and a frog-like marsh giantess, a man with a trident and a man with a mace burst out.
* Rupert tries to engage the bird but gets grappled. He is unable to break free.
* Mace dude and trident dude throw out lots of horrible spells, marsh giantess smacks people around for lots of damage.
* The Slimy bird carries Rupert off then throws him to the ground behind the mansion. Val goes to have a look.
* Rupert manages to escape, and the bird goes after Val. He nearly dies, except Eldas' Liberating Command allows him to break free.
* Rupert mashes the mace dude, then is forced to flee inside the mansion. Marsh giantess gives chase, but Rupert can hold the doors shut.
* Clara would rather die than let her wolf die. She almost does.
* The slimy bird grabs Clara and lifts her high into the air, then throws her at the ground.
* Elowyn saves her life with her power to cast feather fall.
* Val de-bones mace dude, he is blasted unconscious, and then dropped into a pit.
* Rupert chats with the giantess, since she can speak with animals. She is guarding the chamber for the high priest. This is strange, since marsh giants are solitary creatures who rarely associate with humans.
* The slimy bird takes off after the marsh giant. She flees and it gives chase.
* Trident dude has some nasty death-dealing spells, and can sometimes block magic missiles. We eventually kill him.
* His head explodes into a mass of tentacles and sanity effects happen again.
* It grabs Elowyn and tries to drag her towards the lake.
* We eventually kill it, and the tentacles explode into lots of tiny leeches. One attaches to Clara's neck and burrows under her skin.
* Rupert squishes leeches, Eldas burns them.
* Clara slashes at her own neck twice before Eldas can get there and surgically extract it.
* We hear the dread squawk of the slimy bird, and assume it killed the marsh giantess.
* We loot the cultists.
* We look inside the mansion

* Inside is a stone circle, the menhirs speak of a powerful being from the Dark Tapestry - The Dark Tapestry is full of madness-causing weird creatures, like tentacle creature and slimy bird.
* On one of the menhirs is a human-sized magical square (conjuration) with a small impression that matches the medallion we found on the trident dude.
* In the central altar is a compartment that contains a rough brown seed pod. It is not from any creature in nature, and does not currently have aberrations in it. Nobody touches it.
