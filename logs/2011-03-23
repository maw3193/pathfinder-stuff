* We dick around in town:
** Val gets some cosmetic eyeglasses and near-constantly casts prestidigitation so that nobody can see his eyes.
** Flo also buys some glasses. Apparently Dhampirs are hipsters.
** Eldas scribes a scroll of fly.
** Flo hides and disguises himself from Kazi (formerly named as Kzy, because spelling is hard!). He goes under the name Frederic.
** Eldas casts Diagnose Disease on Val. Rupert listens in. The answer to diagnose disease is apparently "complicated". Eldas says it's what he suspected and uses the scroll of Cure Disease. It doesn't work.

* Half way through the journey, we find an abandoned farmhouse.
** A willow tree with skeletons hanging from it is standing near the house. It is a hanging tree, which uses mind-control spores to lure its victims towards it.
** Eldas fireballs it and we fight.
** Rupert finds out we can speak its language and tells it to only eat bears, and we'll leave it alone.
** Val curses it to only eat bears.
** Kazi destroys it with a warhammer. Rupert is not happy about this.
** We explore the house. Florian finds a yellow-skinned zombie in the cellar and sneak-attacks it to death.
** Val and Rupert come down to see, and recognize it as the alchemical zombie that we let go. It has the crate of alchemical zombie formula with it.
** Val is surprised to find it dead. Rupert is quite angry, having correctly deduced that Flo killed it.
** Rupert curses Kazi.

* We got to Fellgrau, and find Duristan.
** He says that there are mercenaries (plus "Antonio") at the mill.
** He has spotted Princes' wolves nearby, and some red-furred ones.
** We follow Duristan's lead into the town. Florian takes a sniping spot.
** We get attacked by a necromancer and a bunch of undead things.
** Duristan wolfs out and has to be restrained with Hold Person (otherwise Clara would kill him). He is restrained in chains, and spends the rest of the fight thrashing around.
** The necromancer manages to channel energy and cast chill touch, then spends the rest of the fight in a pit. Rupert lobs a ball of fire at the necromancer, then falls it. He burns the necromancer's face off.
** We loot the necromancer. He has:
*** Magic Wand
*** 3 bottles of something
*** Masterwork crossbow
*** Masterwork shortsword
*** Magic cloak
*** Magic ring
*** Spell component pouch
*** Whispering Way amulet
*** 65gp
*** Spellbook bound in human leather
**** TRAPPED! Flo found it and successfully defused it!
**** Every cantrip
**** Chill Touch, Mage Armor, Ray of Enfeeblement, Vanish
**** Acid Arrow, False Life, Scorching Ray
** We cure Duristan of lycanthropy.
*** He is very unhappy about this, because he is evil.
*** We let him go, for lack of an alternative.
** We cure Val of lycanthropy.
*** Eldas accelerates the potency of the wolfsbane. He took 6 constitution damage, but succeeded in the end.
*** YAY! CURED!
