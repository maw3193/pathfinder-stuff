-- UNPAUSE --

The building is inscribed with runic circles, a bit like in Ravengro. Unlike Ravengro, these runes are still active, and are probably part of an active spell. It's not a wild guess to say that these runes (and the ones in the rest of town) are powering the necromantic fog. Naturally, we smash up all the runes we find.
There's also some ominous chanting in the distance.

We fight some werewolves that were guarding the mill. They are quite resistant to fire and have more than one damage resistance. They are, however, terrible at climbing out of pits.
They have loot on them:
* 2x Magic Falchion (unidentified)
* 2x Magic Breastplate (unidentified)
* 2x Amulet of Jezelda
Also explains why they're called "Demon Wolves"

We investigate the mill - There is nothing of interest downstairs, and four
people upstairs. Flo tries to sneak upstairs, but they were expecting that.
Guess what - they're Demon Wolves. Once they're sure we're not working with the necromancers (their leader can Detect Good), they offer us the person we're looking for (they have no idea who that is) in exchange for the Heart. They have someone upstairs who is praying - they are evil and do not speak like werewolves. We decline their offer and leave.

We explore the town square, which is where the chanting is coming from. They are casting Animate Dead. We end up fighting some well-prepared clerics of Urgathoa and their cluster of skeletons. Eldas tries to lob a fireball at them all, but is counterspelled. They cannot do that trick to Kazi, who nukes the skeletons with Channel Energy. Without their fleshless meatshields, they go down quickly.
They have loot on them:
* 2x Scythe +1
* 2x Magic Breastplate (unidentified)
* 900gp onyx gems
* 25gp of silver dust
* 1x Cure Serious Wounds
* 1x Magical flask (unidenified, necromancy aura)
* 2x level 1 pearl of power (1 identified)

Rupert flies up to look at the tower and a bunch of skeletons shoot at him.

We explore north, and find an alchemist's shop full of necromancers and flaming skeletons. Flaming skeletons suck and run up to Clara to be exploded. Kazi also bursts some with Channel Energy.
They have loot on them:
* 2x Unidentified potions
* 2x Masterwork light crossbow
* 2x Masterwork shortsword
* 2x magic cloak
* 2x magic ring
* 2x spellbook
* 2x spell component pouch
* 2x Thieves' tools
* 2x Whispering Way amulet

The alchemy shop still has some things of value:
* 5 non-magical jars of unknown stuff

We find another building to the north. It has Princes' wolves in there. They refuse to open the door, until we say we were sent by their boss, with proof. Werewolf Gerald whines about opening the door. We get some elaboration about the situation in town:
* Princes' wolves, Demon wolves and necromancers are locked in a mexican standoff.
* Necromancers are the strongest, are building an army and shipping it off somewhere.
* The leader of the demon wolves here is the alpha wolf, Admarus.
* We plan to assault the necromancer tower, and send a signal to the Princes wolves when we have destroyed the heart (denying other clans succession). When the Demon Wolves try to take advantage of the situation, the Princes Wolves will flank them from behind.

We assault the tower from the rear, and get shot at by skeleton archers. Eldas is ludicrously well-buffed and burns skeletons with spells. Flo and Clara pull skeletons off the tower, where they try to attack Val. Val casts Command Undead on a skeleton and has a new pet. Once the skeletons are destroyed (except for Val's pet), we go downstairs.

We find Vrood, and Rupert and Eldas are fascinated by the paintings of innards.
Vrood apparently buffed himself for combat, then dissected a cat while he was waiting for trouble. He has apparently been watching us for long enough to know about Harley and Antonio. He freely admits to killing Lorrimor, and combat starts when Val tries to blind him.
* He's immune to curses.
* Kazi charges him and is surprised by a pair of giant undead hands, one of which grapples him. He spends several rounds grappled, injured and dying before he can be rescued.
* Eldas spends a lot of time counterspelling, trying his best to stop Vrood from casting any spells (Because he is a powerful necromancer. All his spells are bad news).
* Vrood uses some kind of desecrate aura, and the skeleton no longer obeys Val's commands, instead taking potshots at Flo, then Val.
* Val spends half the combat being shot at by a skeleton, which doesn't worry him at all. The rest of the time he futilely tries to blind Vrood, or kill/frighten the hands. In retrospect, greasing the people grabbed by hands would have been better.
* Flo sneak attacks things, then gets grappled by a hand. Most of the damage inflicted on him is either absorbed by Rupert or ablated to non-lethal.
* Clara takes on dragon-like features and grapples Vrood, severely hampering his spellcasting ability.
* Clara rolls a 1 while wearing Harley's gauntlets, and something permanent happens. Notably she can't switch to her Glaive.
* Kazi is eventually free, revived and smites Vrood to death. His jaw melts off. We loot him, decapitate him, and burn his body. We burn his art on his burning corpse.
Vrood's loot:
* 1 staff that is also a rod (unidentified)
* 1 wand (unidentified)
* 1 amulet (unidentified)
* 1 ring (unidentified)
* 1 spellbook (unread)
* 1 spell component pouch
* 1 whispering way amulet
* 1 Non-magical bone breastplate. It looks pretty cool.

Searching the room, we find a satchel which has complicated research notes, a scroll tube which Clara finds - it has some complicated prophecy of some kind.
There is also a locked chest which contains:
* 50lbs of silver dust (250gp as a commodity)
* A big bag of onyx gems
* A scroll of control undead
