* We let the priest go and he tells us about fostering. It's a tradition to marry some of their daughters to The Neighbours. We let him out, then bolt the temple doors behind us again.
* Elowyn casts Water Breathing and we explore the tunnels. It is dark, claustrophobic and all the tunnels we explored lead to random pools in the Sodden Timbers. After 3 hours of this, we grab our mounts and head back to the mansion.
* Rupert and Elowyn search the pond again, but finds nothing new.
* Val and Eldas go inside, and see a spectral figure at the stone circle. She was the other spectre we fought upstairs. She claims to be a friend, and apparently had a big disagreement with the other spectre about helping the party.
* Rupert gets the idea of Thousand Facing into the high priests. When he does that with a part of the priest, it fools the portal into letting him through.

* Rupert uses the ear drops and gets a private audience with his god, who warns him about compost and gives him knowledge of eldritch lore without the sanity loss.
** He still acts unhinged, though.

* We all go through, including our spectre friend.
* There is a bell which is the focus of an Alarm spell, Cassius Undiomeded in a jar and a sharkskin book.
* The book is Cassius' journal. We dispel the Alarm and read a couple of entries. He started out as a smuggler and became a lord that lived very comfortably.

* SHARK MAN! SHARK MAN! SHARK MAN! SHARK MAN! AXE! SHARK MAN! NOT FRIENDLY! SHARK MAN! IMMORTAL! SHARKMAN! NOT AN ABBERATION! SHARK MAN! little fish/shark men. They are Skum.
* Little skum are dead/dying. SHARK MAN! IMMOBILISED. SHARK MAN! DEAD!

* We explore a side passage and find steps down to a compost heap. We wisely turn back.
* We explore where the SHARK MAN! came from and find two dead skum who were clawded/bitten to death.

* We also find Clara's body. They ate her guts.
* Spectre friend helps us speak with her spirit.
** She refuses to Reincarnate because of noble honour nonsense.
** She refuses Raise Dead (which would be very hard to accomplish, anyway)
** We ask her if she has any unfinished business for us to take care of:
*** Tell her family she died doing what she loved.
*** Look after the horse
** We take Clara's stuff (listed in Loot). Notably, it includes Silverheart identity papers and a Silverheart signet ring.

* We head in deeper, and Elowyn gets a deep feeling of Listlessness. We detect an Enchantment effect on her.
* This chamber is full of glowing violet fungi and dessicated, hollow corpses.
* We find one corpse that did not die like that, instead she fell down a hole.
** Very malnourished, when spoken to, only spoke of "Pretty Colours", "Baby gone" and "What's fostering?". No idea what she was doing here.

* We follow a very long passage to another cavern, and lots of people get drained by a threatening glow. It is also strange enough that everyone takes Will save damage.
* Val and Eldas lob lots of magic missiles at it, until it resorts to hit-and-run tactics.
* There is a magic box in the centre of the cavern, with some kind of Abjuration thread between the glow and the box.
* Also a pile of various stuff in the corner.
* We head back to explore the other passage.

* After a long walk it reaches a long, deep sunken passage.
* While it's being scouted out, Eldas finishes reading the journal
** Cassius was a smuggler who used the local area for ordinary smuggling.
** One day he met a fishman who struck him a deal - he would transport Cassius' goods in exchange for a maiden from the local town once a year.
** This went on for a while and the authorities never caught him, until he was made Lord of a new settlement, Baytown, in the hope it would stop him smuggling.
** The fishmen (known as The Neighbours) expanded the deal to the Fostering Pact - they would steer fish towards the town and give them fish gold, in exchange for the second and third daughters of every household being fostered to The Neighbours.
** The Neighbours live at the bottom of the Tern Rocks.
** Fostering happens through the stone circle (which Cassius built his manor around) and the Temple, which was built around the waterways that The Neighbours use.
** The people of Illmarsh happily foster their daughters because it brings them good luck.
* We decide not to explore the deep, dark underwater tunnels, and go back to fight the glow.
** We kill it with magic missiles and regain our Will save, after seeing that even weird things that make no sense can be killed.
** Elowyn is no longer listless.
* We check out the treasure, including smashing open a chest of coins.
* We check out the magic box - it is made of a strange metal and has screws in it (things not invented in Golarion yet). There are dials on the back which can turn its magic off (WTF!?!)
* Eldas carefully melts the braces that held it bolted to the floor, and takes THE BOX!

* We take Clara's body and leave this place, burying her in the lake.
* We then head off to find a place in the Sodden Timbers to sleep for the night.

* Mia lands at Horace's pier and has a brief chat with him.
* Mia then visits Illmarsh and hears a lot of angry plotting from outside the pub, where the locals are drinking themselves into an angry mob to hunt the outsiders.
* Mia heads back to Horace.
* At around the same time the party appear.
* Mia is disguised to look like an elf, but has quite large eyes (~*ANIME*~)
* We give the worst first-impression we possibly can, with the exception of actually killing someone in front of her, by admitting we killed the town's priesthood in front of her (in self-defence), Rupert being quite unhinged and Eldas not being too sound either.
* Val spends most of it moping.
* Mia is after something the Whispering Way took, but is being quite guarded about saying what.
* We camp together for the night.
* Val hears the angry mob wandering around trying to find the party, but they don't find them.

* The next morning, we find out Mia is looking for the Sea Sage Effigy. We tell her what we know of its location.
* We then go to see Horace, who is planning to send SERV on its first proper voyage.
* He gives some basic instructions of pull the bell once to stop, twice to pump more air, and three times to bring it back up.
* Rupert casts Telepathic bond, rendering that pointless.
* BIG CRANKY WENCH

* It is a very slow, stuffy descent, where the sea gets gradually darker, and after about 30 minutes, starts to get gradually brighter.
* Then something very angry below us attacks SERV
