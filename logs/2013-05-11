==========

* Florian buys a ribbon for his new pet necromancer.
* Val's eyes have gotten worse. He now has no irises. This makes him even creepier than before.
* Val is sad, so drinks cider/absinthe with Flo and Clara.
  - Flo feeds cider to the necromancer and poisons him.
  - Rupert cures him.
* The next day, Val and the necromancer are massively hung over.
* Clara tries to get her weapon back from the guard, but the central blade has been stolen. Eldas tries to fix it, but can't restore its magical properties.
* The guard pointed in the direction the necromancer fled by.
  - Rupert finds no human tracks going that direction.
  - Val tries to intimidate a correct answer out of him, but can't think of any proper questions.
* We go hunting. Eldas and Kazi stay behind, Rupert puts a telepathic link between everyone but Val and Kazi. Also, apparently Flo has named the necromancer JoJo.
* We find a cottage in the woods. An old woman who often expects guests lives there. She invites us in for tea.
  - Florian tries to feed the necromancer tea. It doesn't try it.
  - The old woman sells Val some blue dust, claiming it will give him the answers he needs.
  - She sells Rupert 12 magic drops of stupidly strong divination. Administer 3 drops in the ear when you need assistance.
  - What Florian needs is beyond her power, but she'll give him something that helps for 4000gp. He is given it in secret, and claims that she conned him.

* We set off again for Hyannis. The next morning, Val snorts his magic powder and gets a dreamlike vision. Elsbeth and the vampire are fighting each other on top of a plateau. He tries to get her to leave him alone by throwing her a bag full of money. Elsbeth picks up a sovereign from the bag.

* Rupert tells the tale of the bear lord, a story he heard from somewhere, either a tale from his uncle, or a nightmare.
* Grand Magister Alex built a town in the country of Westdave, and it has been suffering animal attacks. Adventurers are called into the area, and meet in a tavern.
* Alex's assistant, Timothy the Small, meets the adventurers and fills them in. He gets a bit terrified with tales of flying bears. Eventually, bears burst into the tavern.
* These bears aren't very dangerous, but we see a huge bear skulking outside. It turns into an air elemental and flies away.
* We follow the normal bears' tracks out of town and find a lumbermill.
  - There is a deep, clean-cut shaft that was pulled out of the earth by magic.
  - There is a lumber camp, which the villagers use to correct Alex's mistakes.
* We continue to follow the tracks, to the Bear's grove. He saw us coming.
* He has a secret conversation with the party druid, Paddington. It is made of threats and enlisting the druid's help.
* Combat starts. The nightmare bear is horribly buffed, has summoned help and a friendly dire bear.
* Val climbs a tree and one of the bears tries to climb after him. Bears are not known for their climbing skills. It takes the bear several turns to get nowhere.
* Paddington, the treacherous druid, has much better success - he fails to turn Val into a squirrel, then gets bull rushed out of his tree.
* Flo sneak-attacks the dire bear frequently, and does lots of damage.
* Clara chops up the summoned bears.
* Kazi smites the bear and smacks it around for most of its health. The bear eats his head in revenge.
* Paddington puts down an ice storm and the nightmare bear puts down an obsidian flow. This is not particularly dangerous. The nightmare bear then runs up to Val.
* Due to a temporal anomaly, Val dispels Paddington's flight before the bear gets there.
* The big bear then chews on Val's face. It hurts quite a lot, then he's grappled.
* Flo saves him by sneak-attacking the nightmare bear to death. Eldas holds the treacherous druid and the whole story is over.

* We reach Hyannis. It's a large town built into the mountainside. It has lots of dwarves, and some druids.
* Winter has hit. It's quite cold.
* Eldas finds a library to do research with. It charges 100gp, with a 50gp deposit. The next day, he tries to find fireball written down somewhere. It doesn't have that, or any information on the Carrion Crown.
* Rupert finds a small druid commune, and hangs around with them instead of paying for a room in the 6-legged ox.
* Val does surprisingly well at flirting with the bar lady.
* Clara tells some good stories at the tavern, but fails to get off with a dwarf.
* We gather information in the town - Some riders were in town 8 days ago, and were carrying two heavy crates. We're not sure where they're headed, except for South.
* Eldas casts Divination several times, and eventually asks a specific enough question to get an answer - The heart and effigy are on a road by the coast of Avalon Bay.
* Our plan to catch up to them is to use Phantom Steed - Rupert upgrades the ring of spell knowledge to 3rd-level, then we get a scroll of Phantom Steed. It will take us 2 days to reach Thrushmoor, the largest town in the local area.
