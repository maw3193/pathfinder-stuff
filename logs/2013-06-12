rtal doesn't reopen. Clara is stuck :(
* This is apparently a deliberate entrance control - maybe there are other ways in.
* Rupert Thousand Faces into a merfolk and explores the lake. He finds the corpses we put there, and an old carriage.

MEANWHILE IN A STRANGE LAND
* Clara is in a very dark place.
* There is no portal leading back, only a flat stone wall.
* There is a staircase leading down, by the total lack of dust, this place has been left unused for a long time
* There is the smell of compost.
* It leads to a cave system, with creatures with very flat feet pacing about.
* Clara sneaks past them and finds a purple glow.
* She fails a will save, and is filled with listlessness and ennui.
* She hears creepy nursery rhymes.
* She heads down deeper, but the smell of compost gets stronger.

MEANWHILE IN A SLIGHTLY LESS STRANGE LAND
* We speak to the spectre. He is slightly more helpful since we're fairly doomed already.
* A cavern lies through the portal, the cavern has an exit, but he doesn't know where it leads.
* The portal key is an Undiomede heir loom, which can be re-used after 24 hours.
* The high priests of the Dagon cult, the Voltero family, don't need a key.
* They usually do a knocking ritual, but have passed through without doing it.
* We plan to go to town and investigate the temple.

MEANWHILE IN A STRANGE LAND
* Clara goes up a bit and finds a ladder. Going up it to a ledge, she finds a bunch of dressmaker dummies of adults and children.
* They are not dummies, they are dry corpses that crumble to the touch.
* Clara sneaks past the purple glow and finds a long passage to a flooded chamber.

MEANWHILE IN A SLIGHTLY LESS STRANGE LAND
* We stroll up to the temple, and the priests attack us on sight.
* 4 standard priests attack us from the foyer, but don't pose much of a threat.
* We do a bit of searching, and find a high-priests's bedroom, and then the high priest in another room, who also attacks.
* Val successfully ruins a lot of the priest's bones, and Eldas kills him.
* A large crab-man teleports in and attacks. It has spell resistance.
* It prefers to attack clerics.
* Val curses the crab, various people who are grabbed break free, and it teleports away.
* The creature is identified in being very similar to a Chuul.
* We search most of the temple, including the dead priests and the high priest's sea chest.
* One of the side rooms has a painting of Cassius Undiomede, and the other has a painting of a Scumm (a race of aquatic humanoids)
* Eldas' detect thoughts finds people cowering behind a wall - Rupert successfully finds the false wall, and we find the crab.
* Val shatters its shell and it explodes.
* Inside the sea chest is:
** 2 square glass bottles
** 2 brass vials
** 1 feather
** 3 statuettes in red gold: A tentacle thing, a fish/frog man, A creature with an octopus head and dragon wings

* Behind the false wall is a creepy altar that depicts the underwater monster mash with humans and fish-people.
* We find the fostering couple in one of the side rooms. They have terrible luck.
* We find a pile of headless bodies in the other side room. One looks to be dressed like a merchant, possibly Gastor Lucas?
On the merchant is a note: "Rider on the way with effigy. Meet at house to exchange"
* The side rooms also have fairly deep pools, which have an underwater passage.

MEANWHILE IN A PLACE FRAUGHT WITH DANGER
* Clara continues to explore the tunnel and finds a malnourished woman who hasn't been outside in a while. She is cradlign a baby.
* Clara takes the baby to get them both to safety, and the woman begins wailing.
* Clara touches the baby and it disintegrates like the other husks, after this, the woman is quiet and unresponsive.
* Clara takes the woman with her and walks into a room of bright floating light. The light does lots of drais and damage, but doesn't pursue Clara. There are more husks in this room.
* Clara eventually sneaks back to the pacing creature. This time she decides to fight it.
* It grumbles in an unthreatening tone, so Clara approaches cautiously. It charges her.
* Clara dies :'(
