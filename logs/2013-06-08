* We find Kazi strapped to a bed.
* His god, Irori, sent him to the mansion to deal with a thing beneath the manor.
* He walked in the door, got knocked out by the giantess, got strapped to a bed and slashed a bunch of times. He does not appear to have been implanted with leech parasites.
* We find a storeroom with a saddlebag that may have once contained the sea sage effigy.
* We hear people cowering in one of the side rooms. Kazi steps in to find 1 priest, and a couple of commoners holding a baby.
* The priest is definitely evil, and very unfriendly. When he hears Elowyn is a Gozreh worshipper, he draws a flail and attacks. He gets mashed into paste.
* The commoners claim we murdered him, and are no friendlier. They claim to be the same religion as the priest, but do not say which religion that is.
* We let them go. As they walk past Clara, she overhears them saying "Some other priests will be Fostering"
* We loot the flail priest.
* Kazi recognizes the unholy symbol to be related to the Dark Tapestry.

* Another room downstairs has a puddle. When approached, a tick swarm bursts out and engulfs Rupert.
* After many frantic attempts to save Rupert, Kazi is killed and Rupert reaches -9 HP before being stabilised.
* We eventually decide to bury Kazi and the priests in the lake - we take Kazi's hand to resurrect him the next day.

* We head back to the jetty we met Horace the inventor at - he is not there.
* Clara peeks under the tarpaulin and sees a metal fish.
* We argue about where to camp for a long time, and are attacked by a giant octopus.
* Josh makes the dumbest statement of the adventure - "If it's got reach" about the octopus whose tentacles are attacking us while it's underwater.
* Rupert, Clara and her wolf spend most of the battle in its reach - It has some difficulty hitting and grappling Clara, but none grabbing Rupert.
* Through rule-bending, Val manages to get Liberating Command in his ring of spell knowledge, and is able to help people out of the grapple.
* Clara defends her wolf over her own safety, and only after a fair bit of pelting with magic, with only Clara left in reach, does the creature withdraw.
* We camp out in the sodden timbers and Reincarnate Kazi in the morning.
* Val and Rupert suffer disease from tick bites - Kazi cures Rupert and Eldas cures Val.
* Elowyn reveals that the townsfolk worship Dagon, a Lawful Evil deity of the sea, often worshipped by people associated with the dark tapestry, and highly insular communities - Fits Illmarsh to a tee.

* We find Horace, and find out that the island out in the bay, Turn Rocks, is a prison island.
* When Clara reveals that she knows about the metal fish (because she's psychic), he talks about it - It's a Subaqueous Exploration and Research Vessel. He is still experimenting with it.
* He is wholly unconcerned that the temple is not of Gozreh.
* Word from town is that the mayor and his advisor, plus a couple of church people have disappeared.

* Elowyn does Augury, and has a bad feeling about the portal.
* Eldas does Divination:
Q: Where will we find the one we know as Early Greedle
A: He lies in the beneath named in Kazi's quest

* We head back to the manor and search the upper floor. This manor used to belong to the Undiermead family, that started with Cassius Undiermead, back when it was known as Baytown.
* It came to be known as Illmarsh because it was often stricken by plagues that came from the Sodden Timbers.
* We enter a hallway which has four paintings (they're all similar-faced sinister-looking men)
* It starts with Cassius Undiermead, Pact Forget, and ends with Claudius and Manos Undiermead (an old man and a young man, the young man looks less sinister, and apparently murdered his father ~70 years ago).
* We enter a side-room which has sunlight streaming in from a hole in the wall. Clara's wolf refuses to enter and Val detects undead lurking in the corner.
* One is destroyed quickly, and Val casts Command Undead on the other one. He was a tax collector that found out too much, now he's a spectre that is powerless under sunlight.

* A dark place lies beneath the mansion.
* He learned the secret of Illmarsh and was killed for what he knew - he refuses to reveal the secrets for our safety.
* The portal leads deep beneath.
* The Watcher is a serpentine creature that has been around since he was alive, maybe 300 years ago.
* The neighbours may be a town down-bay, which presumably refers to being further south along the coast, but Rupert and Eldas suspect it means underwater.
* We can send the spectre to his final rest, but he does not want that - He does not know what awaits him in the next life, and will continue to try and scare adventurers away from discovering dangerous secrets.
* He tells us about the other dangers in the mansion - the master bedroom has some otherworldly beings which are natural hunters. They are here because of the pact, and are not worth the risk to fight - there are safer ways to uncover secrets.
* There is a mould hiding in a cabinet two doors down.
* The spectre doesn't know what the seed pod's for. Kazi uses Detect Evil on it and finds out Yes. Very.
* The spectre did not know about the slug parasites.
* The spectre tries to lie about why people would come to foster babies to the priests. He eventually admits that it is not a sacrifice.

Spectre (to Eldas): "What will you do when your magic fails you?"
Clara:   "He whinges for four weeks!"

* To break the pact would doom the people of Illmarsh in the short-term, but possibly improve it in the very long term.
* The Whispering Way are probably here for old secrets. This can only be bad news.
* Re-reading the prophecy, it may be to do with a "stillborn cocoon" or "a hundred slain innocents"
* The Spectre tells us that the neighbours visit Illmarsh, never the other way round.
* The island prison might be where people who know too much about Illmarsh's secret, or spread the secret too much, are sent.

* We try to glean knowledge from the standing stones - It's a symbol to an elder god. Elder gods are things from the dark tapestry, and are often a focus of worship by cults.

* We activate the portal by putting the key in the socket. Clara goes through and the key falls out, deactivating the portal.
