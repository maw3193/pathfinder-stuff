-- UNPAUSE --
* We fight Marthus (werewolf ranger) and Cybrisa (werwolf druid)
** Cybrisa never gets a shot off, because her spellcasting is interrupted with
   acid arrows and is plagued by wasps. She flies away without causing anyone
   any harm.
** Marthus is smacked around with a glaive, and eventually Held. We disarm him,
   chain him up, and get him to talk. He has to hold the High Throne or he'll
   be killed. We agree to consecrate the place, then leave.
** We clean up the place, Clara makes a lovely speech about making the wood safe
   for people of all kinds, friend and foe alike, and the temple is consecrated.
** Marthus is not interested in communing with Desna, so we leave him rather
   than activate the Dust Moth.
** Eldas takes Val aside to warn him that he may have contracted Lycanthropy.

* We try to find Duristan.
** His hirelings are found dead, with strange wolf prints we haven't seen before
** They were killed with claws, but doesn't look like Vollensag.
** We loot the hirelings:
*** 60gp, which Florian takes
*** 4 longswords & 4 sets of leather armour (Clara barters them for supplies)
*** 80 arrows with expired silversheen, which florian takes.

* We follow the trail, and are approached by werewolves with peaceful intent.
** The leader has a name that begins with R, but I can't remember the rest.
** They are the Prince's wolves, so named because they served with a prince
   against the Whispering Tyrant, a long time ago. They assimilate into human
   society better than other clans, and will not attack the lodge.
** Marthus Mordenacht, with the Whispering Way, slew the previous High King and
   tore out his heart. Rather than consume it and become the new High King,
   Marthus gave it to the Whispering Way, who have taken it away to Fellgrau.
** Fellgrau is a ghost town. We do not know how literally true this may be.
** This caused a succession crisis. If no wolf can consume the heart of the old
   ruler, then rulership can only be proven with war.
** Duristan's hirelings were killed by the Demon Wolves, who are now chasing
   after the Whispering Way, so they can consume the High King's heart and claim
   the throne.
** Since the Demon Wolves are busy, Duristan is likely to have escaped.
** We find out that Estovian has control over the werewolf Ancestor Spirit,
   which is the thing that possessed Corvin and murdered those people. Wolves
   do not know how he has that power over it, but we suspect that necromantic
   stone.
** The Princes Wolves give us free passage through their territory.
** We take them up on their offer of shelter in the Temple.
** At the temple, we witness the Princes Wolves' leader kill Marthus and eat his
  heart, then howl his victory to the whole of Shudderwood.

* Everyone but Flo do the ritual with the Dust Moth
** We see a vision of a figure hunched over a desk. He has a large black cloak
   and is holding a bloody scalpel. He has glowing red eyes, and is wearing
   bone plate armour.
** We see a vision of a place far at sea. Deep under the water, a black
   silhouette of a hideous creature with tentacles is waiting.
** We see an underground chamber. A pale, fragile woman casts a spell. She
   resembles the dhampir party members, probably because she is a vampire.
** We see a high tower with a storm brewing. A figure of a rotten, decaying
   skeleton is flying above it. He casts a powerful spell, and the visions end.
** Everyone but Florian (because he wasn't there) gains an ability score point.
** We all level up.

* The next morning, we arrive at the lodge. Estovian is not seeing any visitors,
  not even us.
** We collect harley's belongings, which include but are not limited to:
*** The Keen longsword.
*** Harley's gauntlets.
*** A vaguely magical bottle. Florian took this.
*** 2 potions of cure light wounds.
*** Assorted weapon blanches.
*** 7 uses of blood block.
*** Full Plate +1 Brawling.
*** Camping equipment, including rope, shovel, crowbar.
** We speak to Madame Ivanja - Val persuades her that the black-robed figure is
   a very evil dude.
*** For 250gp, we have one hour with the girl he hired.
*** Val is confused and disgusted, deciding to wait outside.
*** We speak to the girl. She is insufficiently dressed.
**** Vrood and two associates visited her, requesting a dance.
**** They are joined by a man with silver hair and beard - Marthus Mordenacht.
**** The girl was taken outside, and was not privy to the meaning of the meeting
*** Florian gets laid on Eldas' money.

* Eldas casts Status on Val. He is Cursed and Diseased, but has no symptoms
  matching Lycanthropy - probably because Lycanthropy shows no symptoms until
  you change.
** The whites of Val's eyes are bleeding into his iris. Don't know what's
   causing that, possibly the disease.
** It is not the coin - that lies dormant until it's brought to its counterpart
** It is not the scarf, but the scarf is linked to the coin in some way.

* We chase after the werewolves.

-- 2 ½ days later --

* The party arrive in a nearby trading town on the other side of Shudderwood.
** Val and Eldas price up transport options - 75gp per real horse, or 25gp for
   a scroll of Mount - we use the scroll, and Val casting Mount from his ring.
** Rupert meets Alex's new character, Kzy. He is a Garundi meatslab wearing
   half-plate, and wielding a warhammer and scimitar.

Why would you want to buy a raccoon?
OMG! I want to buy a raccoon!

** Kzy [knows about the adventuring party|is a massive fanboy], and that
   they're after the Whispering Way. His agenda is to pursue a traitor to his
   homeland, Dav, who worked with the Whispering Way and put a bandit warlord
   in control of his home town.
** The rest of the party meet him. Clara is mistaken for Harley (:'(), Florian
   is massively suspicious of Kzy.
** Clara trades tales for a room for the night.

-- The next day --

* The party (excluding Kzy) head to Lorrimor's lab. 

** There is an animal near the entrance. Rupert suspects a bear.
** Florian teases Rupert with the mounted bear head. Rupert retailiates by
   becoming Florian. Florian is vain enough to flirt with an image of himself.
** It's a bear. A large, mutated bear. With negative energy affinity.

DO I RECOGNIZE THE BEAR‽
Well, it wasn't horribly mutated when you last saw it.

** It mauls Eldas a bit. Rupert flies away and throws fire at it, while shouting
   BEAR! BEAR! BEAR! Eldas holds it with Chain of Perdition. Florian snipes the
   hell out of it. Val drains a bit of its life, and curses it. Clara chops its
   head off.
** The lab has been smashed in and made into a bear nest. There is one item of
   note, a grey ioun stone lying in the corner.
** Eldas recognizes it as a very bad thing, and advises strongly against using
   it.
** Val tries to identify it. It's an ioun stone, and the necromancy is linked to
   the kind of healing caused by Vampiric Touch. The activation word is
   'activate' in Abyssal.
** Val puts it on. It takes an erratic orbit around his head, and gives him a
   headache, and tingling on his extremities.
** Eldas suppresses it with Dispel. The headache and tingling go, but Val is
   disorientated.
** Dispel ends, and the stone becomes active again. Along with tingling and
   headaches comes nausea and feeling drained. Val loses consciousness and Clara
   removes the stone from his head.
** Eldas finally reveals that he's seen the ioun stone before - It affected him
   badly during his childhood, but only after Clara threatens to use it.

** Clara notices that Val's eyes have gotten worse, and tells him about it
   behind the scenes.

* Random encounter when travelling back:- Scarecrows.
** We ride past some scarecrows, and have to make a will save. With Rupert's
   help, we all pass the save, and barely notice anything.
** Rupert is aware Unity is used, so suspects the scarecrows. He lobs a flame at
   one of them.
** Eldas fireballs three of them. They all attack Rupert at once.
** Clara manages to kill two of them with opportunity attacks.
** Val drops two of them into a pit. The last one outside the pit is dealt with,
   then Eldas fireballs the scarecrows in the pit. While flying.
** Florian is taken on a magical flying journey, then we all land on our horses
   and ride home.
