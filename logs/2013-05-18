* The party leave Hyannis, heading for Thrushmoor.
* As we pass by the forest of Sodden Timbers, we find we're being followed by a pack of wolves.
* Clara knows them, having been spending the past couple of days making friends with a wolf.
* They seem cool, so we let them follow us around, and hunt with them.
* On the night of the full moon, Florian, the wolf pack's alpha, and three other wolves change into Demon Wolves.
** One of the werewolves flurries and smites a lot. He later turns out to be Antonio.
** One of the werewolves is Duristan.
** The Alpha wolf is some kind of antipaladin.
* Florian crushes his pretty crown and kills the necromancer rabbit.
* Rupert uses True Form to turn Florian back, but he's still wild and uncontrollable, immediately shifting back.
* Val shatters a lot of bones, but when flanked by wolves, tries to remove the threat by creating a pit under himself - He falls in, which is still safer than being flanked by two wolves. He drains ALL the life out of one of the wolves.
* Clara is flanked by three werewolves, including the alpha wolf, who is an antipaladin. After trading a few blows, she takes on dragon features and retreats.
* The alpha wolf pursues her, while the other wolves start tearing chunks out of Kazi, following Kazi's valiant bashing three wolves' heads in. Eldas swoops in to save him from werewolves, then the two of them fly off.
* Rupert summons a bear to keep Flo occupied. It does this by grappling him repeatedly, then dropping him into a pit with werewolf-duristan.
* Eventually, all the werewolves but Flo are dead. Val paralyses Flo and he gets manacled.
* Eldas casts Status and has a look at the people who were bitten by werewolves, and Flo.
* Flo comes up as blessed, glows brightly and vanishes.
* We loot and bury the bodies, Clara makes a note to inform Duristan's family.
* Val is sad.
