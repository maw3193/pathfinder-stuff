* We enter Thrushmor
* Clara goes looking for magic shops - there is an artful one and an industrial one
* Clara visits the artful one, it's an elf with lots of mithril stuff.
* He will repair her glaive, but it will take 1 week.

* Val and Eldas go see the wizard enclave.
** To be given access to powerful spells takes 3 years of training to become a member.
** To visit an Evocation tutor would require waiting until noon tomorrow.
** We visit a random tutor instead - Darsilvius.
** He won't sell any 3rd-level spells, but does have hydraulic push, enlarge person and Identify.
** Identify is much more expensive to sell because they have the monopoly on identifying services.
** Eldas opts to just buy Hydraulic Push.

* Rupert sells some loot and goes shopping - He gets a red dragonhide, wild +1 breastplate.

* Eldas finds a vendor who sells him a scroll of burning hands.

* We scry for Florian:
** Rupert sees him in a dark robe, kneeling on a strange floor, by an altar with a stone jar on it.
* Eldas casts Divination to ask what he's doing - "Worshipping"

* Elawyn the Oracle receives a vision from her god (Gozreh) to seek out the adventuring party and aid them in their quest.
** She goes to the inn they were staying at and waits for an adventurer to appear. She finds Rupert prancing around the tavern in his new armour.
** She has a constant floaty breeze and weird short-range teleport powers.
** Rupert takes on her shape and finds out she has darkvision.
** Rupert introduces her to the rest of the party, and everyone but Eldas goes drinking. Eldas is scribing scrolls, Clara is entertaining some sailors.

* The next morning, Val and Rupert are hung over, Clara is in the sailors' bed.
* Eldas tries to divine more about the nature of the ioun stone:
Q: "Will holding this ioun stone adversely affect me?"
A: "Holding the item of power will have an effect. Adverse is a matter of perspective"
* Elawyn notices Val's creepy eyes and tries to poke them. When Val complains, she tells him to stop being such a downer, and threatens to smother him with affection.
* Eldas casts Sending so Val can send a message to his mother, with a message similar of: "Harley, Antonio dead. Flo gone. Sad. Sovereign cursed, irises gone. What your sovereign curse? Is my dad that vampire? Please don't lie. Love, Val"
Eldas receives the reply: "Sad for your loss. Cannot speak of curse. Do not lose coin. I am fine. Lots of love, Mum"

* Eldas tries to use black-market connections to buy a scroll of fireball. They are not interested in small stuff. Eldas asks them for a scroll of Identify. They walk off in disgust.

* We ride to Illmarsh. The weather is quite stormy.
** We pass by a sailor who is having a lot of trouble, on a ship called the Isenglass.
** Rupert wild shapes into an octopus and swims over to help. Elawyn teleports over to help. Clara and her new wolf animal companion swim over to help. Together, they manage to take control of the ship and land it in port without breaking anything.
** Rupert celebrates with the best salute in the world, then starts dancing.
** The sailor is a mad old inventor named Horace Croon. He does experiments out here because people in Illmarsh don't like him doing them nearby. He has seen a black-robed figure passing by towards Illmarsh some time ago.

* We head into Illmarsh without magical steeds or octopus Rupert. It is evening and there are few people outside. Those who are out stare at the party, suspiciously.
** We head into the tavern and fine a keeper who is professional, but not very friendly.
** We get a room for the night and food in the morning. There is one other guest from out of town, Gastor Lucas. He arrived a month ago on business and has not been seen for 3-4 days.

* Elawyn tries to get entry to the Gozreh temple, but is refused - locals only.
** Unusually, the temple has a roof.

* We find a shop called "Gifts of the Swamp", an apothecary owned by a half-elf named Jarlene.
** Suspiciously, she has a scroll of Protection from Good for sale.

* Eldas spotted a sea serpent.

* Elawyn meditates and gets a vision of some kind.

* The sheriff approaches and warns us not to cause trouble, and says the mayor wants to speak to us.

* The mayor, Early Greedle, needs our help. Fishing harvests are poor and people have been disappearing at random for the past two weeks.
** Only the party can be trusted to not be in on it.
** He will pay with treasure collected over the years, and say where the black-cloaked rider went.

* The general store has wands of Enthrall and Flame Arrow.
** Eldas buys 50ft of rope off him.

* The status is of Cassius of Illmarsh, first of the Sea Lords (or something like that, I didn't write that bit down)

* Eldas casts Divination and is told that the church is not causing people to disappear.

* The apothecary lets slip that the neighbours have disappeared - the neighbours are a town down-lake.

* We head south and find a fork - cross a river and follow the coast, or take the neglected road inland.
** Eldas casts fly on Elawyn, who has a look around and sees nothing along the coastal route, but a structure along the road.

* Clara finds some tracks (a couple of walkers, one heavier, and a horse), and sees something in the pond by the manor.
** We watch the pond and chuck rocks, but nothing happens.
** Val makes a very loud noise, and all hell breaks loose.

* A huge scaly flying thing with a horselike head and slimy wings turns up, everyone passes their will save and gets a permanent -1 to that save.
** Val angrily curses it to look like a normal thing and perceives its true form It doesn't fly by flapping its wings, and it doesn't breathe.
