* We identify and sell most of our stuff
** Except the cloaks of resistance, plenty of people found those useful.
** In total, it goes for 12'235.
** Rupert takes 3000 of that to upgrade a pearl of power to level 3.

* Eldas takes another look at the nasty Ioun stone
** The affect it has is fairly fundamental (like an alignment shift?)
** Val's previous research suggests it has a healing element similar to Vampiric Touch
** Speculation: Causes negative energy affinity and possibly turns you evil.

* Val gets a tattoo. It's magical, and says Necromancy.
** Everyone thinks it was a very bad idea, ignoring my gigantic bluff.

* Kazi removes his curse.
** Eldas fails to remove Val's curse. Probably because it's made of plot.

* Eldas casts Divination, and asks where the Whispering Way are headed next
** The answer is Hyannis.

* Eldas copies all the non-necromantic spells from Vrood's spellbook.
* Val gets Vrood's spellbook rebound.
* Everyone else gets a re-reading of the poem/prophecy. Hooray for vagueness!
* Clara stays behind, and everyone else sets off towards Hyannis.

* On the way, Eldas tells a story
** An adventuring party (Robert Lumberjack, Detective Elvis, Vlad Poyntee and Psy) have been contracted to investigate a spate of nasty murders.
** Victims are found in the town square, lots of nasty claw wounds, a conspicuous lack of blood.
** We speak to a corpse - it can't identify its attacker, but it was attacked along the north road.
** We wander around that way and get accosted by muggers, who are quite self-confident.
*** Vlad tries to blind the only mugger visible and gets shot at by the ones which weren't visible. It hurts a lot because he didn't have his magical protections up.
*** Elvis Holds the leader, and the lackeys either try to run away, fall off a roof or get blinded.
*** Psy falls on one of the lackeys and gets sneak-attacked a lot.
*** Elvis flies up and apprehends the one that tries to run away.
*** The leader gets shot out of nowhere, and paralysed again.
*** The leader tries to use a scroll to teleport away, but explodes instead.
*** We try to apprehend the lackeys - all but one run away. One of the ones that tried to flee suffered some very painful bone injuries. The other disappeared into the sewers.
*** We meet a friendly investigator, who gives us leads: The head librarian (a wizard), the high priest (former cultist), the guard captain, or the former mayor(lives in a mansion).
*** We investigate the librarian first (Wizards have the means for any murder, so are prime suspects). We accuse the wrong librarian, then Elvis interrupts the head librarian's big spell, and refuses to admit he made a mistake. The librarian gives us a motive for the former mayor. Our friendly inspector is facepalming throughout.
*** We head over to the mayor's house, and meet a grumpy butler. He pulls a lever and drops us through a trapdoor, but we drag him down with us.
**** We find the mayor, and he offers us a suspicious ultimatum - leave or die.
**** Because Elvis tries to arrest him, instead, he pulls out some magical device and tries to activate it.
**** Vlad shoots it out of his hand. It explodes, knocking the mayor unconscious and summoning a spectral, half-corporeal bear.
**** Vlad drops it in a pit, Psi tries to smite it, lots of other magic happens.
**** Psi gets swallowed by the bear. Vlad finishes it off with Grasp of the Dead, and Psi smashes his way out.
**** And that is how Uncle <name forgotten> became bald.

* On a following night, they get attacked by a random necromancer
** Eldas traps him in a dome of ice. He waits and wastes time.
** We disarm him, but he succeeds in destroying his spellbook.
** Eventually, Eldas notices that he doesn't have his spellbook. Kazi finds it in the fire. All his spells are completely destroyed.
** We turn the necromancer, known variously as Drayvic Johnson or "The Unstoppable Skeletor", into a rabbit. We gave the rabbit to Flo to look after.

* We arrive at the nearest hamlet, and are asked to hand over our weapons for the duration of our stay.
** Eldas blags keeping his staff, Val hands over his dagger, Rupert and Kazi hand over several weapons each.
