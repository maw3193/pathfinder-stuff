BACKSTORY
=========

Valdemar Sharpe's parents are Elsbeth Sharpe, A half-elf Inquisitor of Iomedae, and a vampire that went by the name of Vandal (His real name's Vando, but he wants to sound cool).

Elsbeth dedicated her life to hunting down evil creatures. She frequently hunted Vandal, but he always escaped. Eventually, rivalry blossomed into something more, and she stopped trying to kill him on sight. Their tryst was short-lived, Vandal disappeared with the same suddenness as he escaped during their hunts, leaving nothing behind but his red scarf.

Some months later (do elves gestate slower? A six-year pregnancy sounds pretty silly), Valdemar was born, and was a curiousity in the county of Vieland as a human baby with the lifespan of an elf. This brought the attention of a young professor Lorrimor, who understood the child was a dhampir, and gave advice on how to keep him safe from others, and from himself:
1. Keep him away from positive energy
2. Don't let him know about his nature
3. Keep him out of trouble

The first two were easy. The church tends to leave retired inquisitors a wide berth, and Valdemar had more fun discovering the world around him than discovering himself.
He was very bad at staying out of trouble. He spent most of his early childhood growing up in a small village, where his friends always outgrew him.
At the age of 20, his best friend, Wendala, told him they couldn't be friends because it upset her boyfriend. After that he stopped making friends altogether, and spent his time wandering the wilderness, often sneaking out in the dead of night.
At the age of 25, Valdemar ran into Professor Lorrimor when he was exploring an old ruin. The Professor brought him back to his mother, and discussed a solution to his wandering. Within weeks they had moved to the city of Vieland, and were introduced to an elven family (Father => Zordlon, Mother => Tessara, Brother => Valdon, Sister => Merisiel) who were friends of the Professor. Not only did Valdemar have friends his own age, but they also helped him to make friends with human children, again.
The rest of his childhood was fairly normal, (from Peter Pan to the Famous Five).
At the age of 35, his magical talents started showing. He could start campfires by magic and he could lie to people with supernatural ease. His magical talents were almost used by a criminal gang until Zordlon found out about them and became his tutor.
Finally, at the age of 50, he gets a letter. Professor Lorrimor has died. Valdemar is mentioned in his will, and must attend his funeral. Elsbeth sends him on his journey with his father's scarf, and some advice:
1. People are suspicious, so pretend to be normal - Tell them you're 16, not 50. Try not to look so pale.
2. Don't trust priests.
3. Don't let anyone steer you down a wrong path - No matter what else happens, try to be a good person.
4. Try not to get any blood on you - That stuff's hard to wash off.

On the way to Ravengro, he had a look at the scarf. In magical writing it told his family history, a long list of names he'd never heard of, ending with Vando.

Valdemar prefers travelling by night, and is often unaware that others can't see in such darkness (partly because his elf friends have low-light vision as well).
