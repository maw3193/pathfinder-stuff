Things that have upset Val over the campaign:
=============================================

* Saw first bloodshed while robbing tomb.

* Found out he was an abomination.

* Saw a ghost that was trapped in this world. (still the only non-evil undead
  he has ever seen).

* Saw some very grisly murder scenes.

* Saw someone die in front of him (even if he did get better).


* Lepidstadt isn't full of nice people, after all. It's full of angry mobs that
  hate monsters.

* A peeled face!

* Hergstag - a village much like the one Val grew up in, with dead kids turned
  into wraith spawn.

** Could very easily have been Val.

** Val was in danger of being killed by a Wraith.

* Accidentally unleashed a lot of Wraiths on nearby villages.

** Val's old village is quite nearby :C

* Val sent his mum away to make sure that his old town is safe.

** If she isn't back in a couple of days, he will be very worried indeed.

* Can no longer trust Florian. He's either cruel or full of bad ideas.

* Got tricked by a bunch of Ghasts, so he let them go. They said they only ate
  animals.

** Later found out they ate a guy.

* Got attacked with lethal force by an angry mob.

** Harley isn't as nice as she always seemed (she started responding with lethal
   force).

* Mostly innocent Mongrel men falling to their deaths in vats of acid :(

* Vorkstag's nasty skin-wearing ways.

** He may escape his punishment, as the Beast was found guilty of his crimes.

* After all our hard work, the Beast was found guilty. There goes his trust in
  justice :-/

** Also the Beast turned into a monster and gibbed a guy right in front of him.


Things that will probably upset Val in future
=============================================

* Val kills someone

* Val's mum dies

* Val's dad turns out to be evil.
