  who want to avoid drawing their problems to the attention of the

  but question her faith.
  - Attends church on the holy day, but stays at the back and avoids
    drawing attention.
  - Has influence with one member of the clergy, an old priest who
    doesn't command much respect but might remember a few secrets.
