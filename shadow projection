Shadow Projection:
    School: Necromancy [evil]
    Level: Sorcerer/Wizard 4
    Casting time: 1 *minute*
    Components: S
    Range: Personal
    Targets: You
    Duration: 1 Hour/Level (D)
    Description: |
        With this spell, you infuse your life force and psyche into your
        shadow, giving it independent life and movement as if it were an undead
        shadow. Your physical body lies comatose while you are projecting your
        shadow, and your body has no shadow or reflection while the spell is
        in effect.

        While projecting your shadow, you gain a shadow's darkvision,
        *defensive abilities*, *fly speed*, *racial stealth modifier*, and
        *strength damage attack*. You do not gain the creature's create spawn
        ability, nor its skill ranks or Hit Dice.

        Your shadow has Hit Dice and hit points equal to your own.

        Your shadow projection has the undead type and may be turned or 
        affected as undead.

        If your shadow projection is slain, you return to your physical body
        and are immediately reduced to -1 hit points. Your condition becomes
        dying, and you must begin making Constitution checks to stabilize.
