I have come across a dhampir in my travels, a rare creature that appears to age slower than its
human counterpart, it has a human mother and I believe a vampire father.

The whispering way may be trying to utilise the aging effects granted by being a dhampir , possibly
by enhancing their necromantic side. I must do further research on this topic.

I have found a second dhampir. I have ensured both should live as normal a life as possible. I will
conduct studies on one of them to further my knowledge of their nature.

Studies on the dhampir have proved inconclusive. No amount of subjection to energies appears to
lengthen their lives or cause them to age faster, I fear I may be too old to observe their breeding
cycles as they age so slowly, however I have left notes in the study, safely secured. I have other more
pressing matters to attend to.
